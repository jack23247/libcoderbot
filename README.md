# libcoderbot

`libcoderbot` is an effort to write a fast, low-level control library for the CoderBot platform. The CoderBot is a Raspberry Pi-based programmable robot intended for educational purposes and, in its original form, exposed a REST API to the programmer for ease of use. 

More informations about the CoderBot platform are available on the [project's website](https://www.coderbot.org), and technical documentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/CoderBotOrg/coderbot/wiki).
